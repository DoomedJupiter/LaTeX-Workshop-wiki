LaTeX Workshop is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), aiming to provide all-in-one features and utilities for LaTeX typesetting with Visual Studio Code.

One million downloads! This project won't be successful without contributions from the community, especially project maintainers Jerome Lelong [`@jlelong`](https://github.com/jlelong), James Booth [`@jabooth`](https://github.com/jabooth), and all code [contributors](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/graphs/contributors)! Thank you!
